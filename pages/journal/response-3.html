          ...connected products that are intended for consumers generally make great emphasis on their "plug-and-play" quality

          Adam talks about Amazon door dash button, where it brought convenience to order a certain product with a click of a button. Nobody really understood
          what internet of things was, but it was a great, simple use of internet of things for consumers.

          at any given moment, virtual assistants are literally listening to us at all
          times, and to everything that is said in their presence. But then,
          of course they are: as voice-activated interfaces, they must by
          definition be constantly attentive in this way, in order to detect
          when the "wake word" rousing them to action is spoken.</q>
        <p class="text-gray-700 my-4">
          Long time ago, there has been a long debate about how Facebook is listening inside your phone whether the app is turned on or not to provide better advertisements
          based on listened conversation between people. Privacy has always been concerns for many people, and it is a big deal because people feel spyed on.
          But then, like what Adam is saying, to provide convenience to consumer, it kind of does need to listen constantly.

          yes: the internet of things is a sprawling and complex
          domain of possibility, and it would be foolish to avoid
          investigating it energetically and in good faith. But we would
          be wise to approach that investigation with an unusually strong
          leavening of skepticism, and in particular to resist its attempts
          to gather data regarding ourselves, our whereabouts, our
          activities and our affiliations, whatever the blandishments of
          ease, convenience or self-mastery on offer.

          What is the good way to provide better UX and at the same time conserve privacy for the consumers?
          How much information does users need to give up for the convenience?
          Can we avoid the need to share information with third parties?
