          Designers make such prototypes to visualize different look and feel possibilities for themselves and their design teams. 
          They ask users to interact with them to see how the look and feel could be improved. 
        </q>
        <p class="text-gray-700 my-4">
          Today, we seem to be making prototypes so that we can communicate ideas that can be clear to the audience. 
          Showing just static images of interfaces don’t always communicate well, 
          and doesn’t really provide the experience for the users to give constructive feedback.

        <q class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-2xl leading-snug">
          By focusing on the purpose of the prototype—that is, on what it prototypes—we can make better decisions about the kinds of prototypes to build. 
        </q>
        <p class="text-gray-700 my-4">
          Sometimes we jump onto making products or prototypes without knowing the purpose. 
          Prototypes are meant to be made test ideas. By focusing on the purpose of the prototype we know what we are exactly 
          “testing" for and this can lead to decisions to the next steps — 
          build different sets of prototypes or continue on building a product on the same idea.

          Designers make integration prototypes to understand the design as a whole, 
          to show their organizations a close approximation to the final artifact, a
          nd to get feedback from users about the overall design. 
        </q>
        <p class="text-gray-700 my-4">
          The article seems to talk about integration prototype to represent complete UX of an artifact to make sure it’s complete. 
          It would be a final step as a prototype to show their organization to provide understandings of the ideas designers have. 
          As a result, the designers can expect feedback on overall design ad confirm it’s use case.
