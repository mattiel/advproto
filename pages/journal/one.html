      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        I chose this ecosystem because it's very natural and seems very obvious to prototype. 
        I wanted to be able to build a natural ecosystem that users can watch peacefully and let it grow.
        In order to have an apple tree grow in an environment, I thought of 3 essential objects that affect the tree: 
        <strong class="underline font-semibold text-blue-600">sun, sky, and cloud.</strong> 
        These objects have certain functions so that apple tree will either grow or die and produce apples. As shown in a diagram below.

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        In order to have an essential environment for a tree, it would also need environmental changes where it would 
        rain on certain occasions and have it's own time so that sun can rise and set.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              I originally thought to have naturally growing environment for a tree to grow,
              but there was no interaction. There needed to be ways for users to be more engaged with the prototype.

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-800">Growing the tree</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              In the code, itw as difficult to find right timing for the enviornment to start raining and how to keep track of
              the environment so that the tree would grow depending on how much sunlight and water it receives.
            </p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Timer using frames</h3>
        <pre class="max-h-96 overflow-y-auto">
<code class="language-java bg-gray-50 rounded-2xl">void updateTime() {
  if (rate >= 1) {
    rate = 0;
    minutes += 1;
  } else {
    rate++;
  }
  if (minutes == 60) {
    minutes = 0;
    hours++;
  }

  if (hours == 24) {
    hours = 0;
    day++;
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4 mb-12">
          Since 30 frames are drawn in a second, I created own updateTime function to update the time every frame.
          Therefore, every second, the prototype's in-time would be 30 minutes.

              Since it would be unrealistic for users to be able to change time, it was more natural for users to create clouds if
              the users want it to rain, so that the user can simply click on the screen and probability of raining will increase as
              numbers of clouds adds up on the screen.

              While clouds are able to be generated from clicking the screen, it's also generated randomly every 1/30 of the seconds.
              It's not implemented yet, but the goal is that the user will have enough balance of precipitation so that the tree won't
              die.

              Right now, it will rain when there are 20 clouds shown on the screen. However, that means that the users can keep clicking 
              on the screen whenever they want it to rain. It would be more interesting to have the chance of rain to increase as the number of clouds increase.

              Sun rises and sets, and it's only hidden when it rains. Right now, the user has to make the environment rain so that the tree will grow.
              However, users will be more engaged in making the rain happen with probabilities, and having them to realize that having too much of water
              will eventually kill the tree. If this is implemented, the users have to make decisions on when create clouds.
