          Design systems offer a different way of thinking, where the designer is forced to consider many scenarios and constraints instead of relying on a one-off design process.
        </q>
        <p class="text-gray-700 my-4">
          I think design systems are a great way to think about the problem at hand. 
          Design systems seem to be in place for a reason and systems are made in a way that the designs are consistant across all products using the system.

      <div class="mb-12">
        <q class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-2xl leading-snug">
          If you rounded up a group of graphic designers and asked them to define the concept of perceptually uniform color spaces, there is a good chance that none of them would know what to say
        </q>
        <p class="text-gray-700 my-4">
          I think the concept of having the uniform color spaces is fairly new amongst the designers, 
          and there are many attempts by different companies to come up with colors and schemes that are accessible and visually pleasing.
          How do we come up with color schemes that are unique, but accessible at the same time? I sometimes feel that WCAG 2.1 compliant colors all seem the same.

      <div class="mb-12">
        <q class="font-bold text-gray-800 text-2xl leading-snug">
          Graphic design is above all a human endeavour, and geometric composition techniques should be used to explore layouts and generate new ideas suitable for the specific content, not as a prison for templating content into a visual monoculture.
        </q>
        <p class="text-gray-700 my-4">
          When I design using the grid system, I often fall into the trap of using the grid system to create a visual monoculture. It makes it hard for me to think outside the box,
          but still use it to create something that is more consistant because I believe consistancy is a key part of design, not ambiguity.
